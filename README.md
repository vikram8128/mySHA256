# SHA 256 demonstrator

This is my simple implementation to learn the SHA 256 algorithm. Do not use it for any real work. Assume that it does not work correctly.

This implements the SHA256 spec from http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf

The variable names etc should match those in the NIST spec.
